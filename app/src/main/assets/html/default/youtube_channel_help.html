<h1>Using multiple Youtube channels</h1>

<p>It is impossible for Watchlater to let you choose which of your channel's watchlater playlists to
add to. If you don't like the channel being used by Watchlater or the selection seems random, you
    have the following possibilities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced">the advanced Youtube account
            settings page</a> and select the desired channel as your default channel. It
        might take a while until the change takes effect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/4570250?rd=1">Set up seperate logins</a>
            for the desired Google+ accounts (channels).</p>
